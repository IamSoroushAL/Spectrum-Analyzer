# Spectrum-Analyzer
A spectrum analyzer measures the magnitude of an input signal versus frequency within the full frequency range of the instrument.
The spectrum analyzer that I designed in this project detects signals in the range of 4 Hz to 40 kHz and the algorithm that analyzes the signal is a C script I wrote based on FFT and DFT.
